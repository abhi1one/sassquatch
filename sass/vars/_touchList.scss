/*  PARAMETERS  */

/* $Z_ : Z Indices */
/* ... */


/* $P_ : Padding */
$P_primary:				px-to-em(16px);		/* In the new dimension schema, this
											* is primarily used for internal padding on
											* cards and boxes.
											*/
$P_secondary:			px-to-em(12px);		/* In the new dimension schema, this
											* is value and its multiples (2x, 3x) are
											* primarily used for external margins around
											* cards, and separating content from the
											* mobile footer.
											*/


/* $W_, $H_ : Height and Width */
$W_mobileCursor:		4px;				/* For iOS/Samsung: Hard coded because fixed width */
$W_pseudoradio:			px-to-em(22px);
$W_gem:					px-to-em(24px);		/* icon gems are 16px with 0.5em padding */
$W_inlineBlockConstant:	4px;

$H_pseudoradio:			$W_pseudoradio;
$H_touchTargetDefault:	px-to-em(48px);
$H_touchTargetMinimum:	px-to-em(32px);
$H_gem:					px-to-em(24px);		/* icon gems are square inside ffbox-fix */


/* $FS_ : Font Size */
/* NOTE: Assumes 1em = 16px browser baseline. These values, for now, need to
 * be used with scoped resets in order to work properly. For touchList, this
 * hasn't been an issue, but it may be in the future.
 * NOTE: For running text, we probably shouldn't go smaller than 12px for
 * font sizes, since type smaller than that becomes difficult to read on
 * LDPI/@1x displays.
 */

$FS_hero:				px-to-em(36px);		/* for use in large banners */
$FS_base:				px-to-em(17px);		/* replaces $FS_label as a std size */
$FS_small:				px-to-em(14px);		/* replaces $FS_text as std text size */
$FS_micro:				px-to-em(9px);		/* use in superscript values (am/pm),
											*	currency, tab titles.
											*	NOTE: this size should only be used
											*	with small caps, which provide good-
											*	enough legibility on low resolution
											*	displays.
