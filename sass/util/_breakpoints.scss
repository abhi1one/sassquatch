You can use the `atMedia` mixin to write styles
specific to a given viewport size.

Building elastic layouts is encouraged, as most
Sassquatch components are designed to fit 100%
width of their parent container.

### Mobile First mixin
This breakpoint system uses a **mobile first**
strategy, meaning the `medium` breakpoint, for
example, applies to _medium screens and larger_.

```scss
	@include atMediaUp(medium) {
		body::after {
			content: "medium screens and larger can see me";
		}
	}
```

Breakpoint name      | Description
---------------------| ---------------------------------------------
`atMediaUp(small)`   | Small screens and up; portrait on most mobile devices
`atMediaUp(medium)`  | Landscape on most phones and up; portrait on some phablets
`atMediaUp(large)`   | Landscape on phabelts and up; portrait on most tablets or old desktops
`atMediaUp(huge)`    | Modern desktop viewports and up or [ridiculous huge tablets](http://liliputing.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/10/fox-big-tablets.jpg)


### Breaking for smaller sizes and under
In the event you need to target a **specific screen size and under**,
use the `atMediaOnly` mixin.

```scss
	@include atMediaDown(medium) {
		body::after {
			content: "medium screens and smaller can see me";
		}
	}
```

Breakpoint name        | Description
-----------------------| ---------------------------------------------
`atMediaDown(small)`   | Small screens and under; portrait on most mobile devices
`atMediaDown(medium)`  | Landscape on most phones and under; portrait on some phablets
`atMediaDown(large)`   | Landscape on phabelts and under; portrait on most tablets or old desktops
`atMediaDown(huge)`    | All screen sizes (huge and under)
